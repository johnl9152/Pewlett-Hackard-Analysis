# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The Pewlett-Hackard is tackling a problem of successfully and cleanly helping out the retiring employees to transition out of their role for the new generation of employees.

The eligible employees will be mentoring the upcoming employees part time during their retirement so that they will receive retirement benefits from Pewlett-Hackard.

In addtion, increasing the criteria that qualifies the retiring employees to cover the upcoming employees to fill their position.
