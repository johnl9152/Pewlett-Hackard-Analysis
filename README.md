# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The Pewlett-Hackard is tackling a problem of successfully and cleanly helping out the retiring employees to transition out of their role for the new generation of employees. One way the company thought to help both parties is through a mentorship program by matching a new employee with an eligible for retiring program employees. The eligible employees will be mentoring the upcoming employees part time during their retirement so that they will receive retirement benefits from Pewlett-Hackard.

- Out of the entire company, 90,398 employees will be retiring soon. Within in that number, majority retirees are upper management level, like Senior Engineer or Senior Staff. 
- Within the entire company, about 13% of the company's total employment is retiring at the moment.
- The data table above shows the results of the mentorship eligibility for the retirees. The main criteria is that anyone who was born before 1965 is eligible for becoming a mentor. However, only about 1500 employees are qualified for becoming a mentor; that is less than 4% of the total retiring employees. Pewlett-Hackard needs to adjust the qualification of the mentorship program in order for smooth transition of the company's upcoming major transition.

## Summary
- Two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami.
  If the company decides to create a mentorship for the retiring employees, that means the employees who are in between of moving up will not be trained enough. The query can be expanded to the currently staying in the company for their role to be eligible for the mentorship program. Through this program, more people will be trained within the company for the smooth transition and the company data will stay in constant flow within from the entry level to senior level.
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
